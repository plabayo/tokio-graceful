Utilities for graceful shutdown of [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) applications.

## Examples

How to use this crate might be easiest to explain
by showing an example, which you can find at
[examples/tokio_tcp.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/tokio-graceful/tree/main/examples/tokio_tcp.rs).

### Example: Hyper

In case you wish to use this library as a [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/) user
you can do so using pretty much the same approach as
the Tokio tcp example. Except that it's a lot easier
out of the box: [examples/hyper.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/tokio-graceful/tree/main/examples/hyper.rs)

## Contributing

:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have
you! We have a [contributing guide][contributing] to help you get involved in the
`tokio-graceful` project.

### Shoutouts

Special shoutout for this library goes to [the Tokio ecosystem](https://tokio.rs/).
Those who developed it as well as the folks hanging on the [Tokio discord server](https://discord.gg/tokio).
The discussions and Q&A sessions with them were very crucial to the development of this project.

In this context also an extra shoutout to [@tobz](https://github.com/tobz) who
gave me the idea of approaching it from an Atomic perspective instead
of immediately going for channel solutions.
